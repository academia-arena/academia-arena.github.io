## Overview
The purpose of this web application is to help incoming students or continuing ICS students connect with their professors. Inspired by trading card games such as [Magic: The Gathering](https://magic.wizards.com/en), [Pokemon](https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-tcg), [Yu-Gi-Oh](https://www.yugioh-card.com/en/), this web app revolves around collectible cards that contain information about the professors on the UH Manoa campus. This information on the card includes a headshot image, the version of the card (ex: "ICS 314 Spring 2024", "ICS 311 Fall 2023", etc.), a fun facts, projects they may have worked on, and the rarity of the card.
